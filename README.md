# Django Luxe Resume Application
*Note* This app is still in it's infancy and not ready for use. If you'd like to contribue to the development, feel free to fork and make pull requests. I'll accept any pull requests that help to move the app to a more _dynamic_ state. This app is currently based off of my personal resume (garet.me)[http://garet.me). Since it's written in Django, I figured I'd publish it as a self-standing app for anyone to use to generate a beautiful and functional resume.

## Todo
- Add the ability to create multiple bios
- Make skills fully editable
- Allow arbitrary text boxes
- Allow multiple versions of every resume component, have the user choose which one to display based on a boolean
- Allow the user to enter in job experience
- Allow the user to enter in projects they've worked on
- Add the ability to link GitHub repositories to projects
- Make the contact form more dynamic (possibly add the ability to change the contact for to a "request a quote" for freelancers.
- Probably add some more shit in the future.
